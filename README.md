## Background:

The MTEL ESL Practice Test App was designed to help educators and students prepare for the Massachusetts Tests for Educator Licensure (MTEL) in ESL. The app allows users to create, take, and review practice tests modeled after the official MTEL format. It was built as a capstone Django project to demonstrate database management, form handling, and dynamic template rendering.

Would you like me to make a slightly shorter “portfolio version” next (2–3 paragraphs with a polished summary + skills section) that you could also use for LinkedIn or your GA showcase page?
